"""Contract tests for METRIC_REGISTRY ↔ validate.run_validation.

The registry in `simace.analysis.validation_schema` is the single source of
truth for validation TSV columns. These tests run a small, parameter-tuned
coverage simulation through `run_validation` and assert that **every**
registered path resolves to a non-None value. If a producer-side rename in
`validate.py` empties a registry-tracked column, this suite fails — which is
the silent-drop bug class this whole refactor closes.
