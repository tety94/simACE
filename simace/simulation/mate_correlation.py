"""Theoretical expected mate liability correlation matrix.

Companion to the generative ``_assortative_pair_partners`` in
``simace.simulation.simulate``: given the same assortative-mating parameters
and ACE variance components passed to the simulator, this module returns the
expected ``R_mf`` matrix that the simulator should produce. Used by
validation and plotting code to compare observed vs. expected mate
correlations. Change one, change the other.

    """Compute the 2x2 expected mate liability correlation matrix.

    Returns E[corr(F_i, M_j)] for i,j in {1,2} given assortative mating
    parameters and ACE variance components.

    With the 4-variate copula algorithm, assort1 and assort2 are target
    Pearson mate correlations. The cross-mate cross-trait correlation follows
    from the mechanistic path: c = rho_w * sqrt(|r1*r2|) * sign(r1*r2),
    where rho_w is the within-person cross-trait liability correlation.

    When ``assort_matrix`` is provided, it is returned directly (the user
    has specified the full R_mf).

    Args:
        assort1: Target mate Pearson correlation for trait 1.
        assort2: Target mate Pearson correlation for trait 2.
        rA: Genetic correlation between traits.
        rC: Shared-environment correlation between traits.
        A1: Additive genetic variance for trait 1.
        C1: Shared-environment variance for trait 1.
        A2: Additive genetic variance for trait 2.
        C2: Shared-environment variance for trait 2.
        assort_matrix: If provided, returned directly as the full R_mf matrix.
        rE: Unique-environment correlation between traits.
        E1: Unique-environment variance for trait 1.
        E2: Unique-environment variance for trait 2.

    Returns:
        2x2 array of expected mate liability correlations ``E[corr(F_i, M_j)]``.
