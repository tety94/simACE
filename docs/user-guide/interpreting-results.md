# Interpreting Results

The pipeline produces diagnostic and summary plots organised into five categories.
All per-scenario plots are generated from pre-computed per-replicate statistics and
downsampled data (capped at 100,000 points) to avoid loading full phenotype files at
plot time. Per-scenario plots are compiled into atlas PDFs.

!!! tip "Regenerating plots"
    Force-rebuild a scenario's atlas:
    ```bash
    snakemake --cores 4 -f results/{folder}/{scenario}/plots/atlas.pdf
    ```

## Reading the atlas

Start with these checks before diving into individual plot details:

| Check | What to look at | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Pedigree structure | `pedigree_counts.*`, `family_structure.*` | Confirms the simulated relationship mix, family sizes, and sampling/dropout shape |
| Liability structure | `cross_trait.*`, `heritability.by_generation.*`, `additive_shared.by_generation.*` | Confirms the realized A/C/E components and cross-trait liability correlations |
| Phenotype separation | `liability_violin.phenotype.*`, `liability_components.by_generation.*` | Shows whether affected individuals are enriched for higher liability as expected |
| Incidence and censoring | `cumulative_incidence.*`, `censoring.*`, `censoring_cascade.*` | Separates true event-time behavior from age-window and death censoring effects |
| Familial signal | `tetrachoric.phenotype.*`, `parent_offspring_liability.by_generation.*` | Shows whether observed familial correlations track the latent liability structure |
| Validation summaries | Folder-level validation plots | Compares observed simulation metrics to configured or theoretical expectations across scenarios |

The sections below describe each plot in detail. They are intentionally
specific enough to support debugging and methods writeups; for routine quality
control, the table above is usually the fastest path through the atlas.

- **Title**: "Joint Affected Status (Weibull) [$\text{scenario}$]" with subtitle showing:
    - `r_tet = X.XXX`: tetrachoric correlation on censored binary affected status.
    - `r_weibull = X.XXX`: cross-trait liability correlation estimated from uncensored Weibull survival data (oracle reference).
    - `(stratified: X.XXX)`: generation-stratified Weibull estimate -- computes per-generation cross-trait correlations and combines via inverse-variance weighting ($\hat{r} = \sum w_g r_g / \sum w_g$ where $w_g = 1/\text{SE}_g^2$). This reduces bias from heterogeneous censoring across generations.
    - `(naive: X.XXX)`: unweighted pooled censored Weibull estimate for comparison (biased when censoring varies by generation). All values averaged across replicates.

## Correlation Plots

Source: [`simace.plotting.plot_correlations`](../api/plotting.md#plot_correlations).
Generated for Weibull frailty phenotypes.

### Tetrachoric correlations by relationship type (`tetrachoric_sibling.png`)

Two-panel figure (16 $\times$ 6 in), one per trait. $y$-axis range: $[-0.1, 1.1]$.

- **Coloured violins**: Distribution of tetrachoric correlations (computed from censored binary affected status) across replicates, one per relationship type (as labelled on the x-axis). These represent the correlations estimable from observed data after censoring.
- **Black dots**: Individual per-replicate tetrachoric correlation estimates, jittered horizontally ($\pm 0.08$).
- **Black dashed horizontal segments**: Mean Pearson liability correlation for each pair type (averaged across replicates). This is the ground-truth correlation computed directly on the continuous latent liability values, serving as the theoretical reference.
- **Green dash-dot horizontal segments** (when available): Mean uncensored Weibull pairwise survival-time correlation. This shows what the correlation would be without censoring distortion.
- **Pair count annotations**: "N=$X$" above each violin (mean pairs per replicate).
- **Legend** (upper-right): "Liability r" (black dashed), "Weibull r (uncensored)" (green dash-dot, when present).
- **x-axis labels**: Relationship type names, rotated 15$^\circ$.
- **Interpretation**: The gap between the violins and the black dashed lines reflects attenuation due to censoring and the dichotomization inherent in the tetrachoric estimate. The green dash-dot lines show the intermediate effect of censoring alone (before dichotomization).

### Tetrachoric correlations by generation (`tetrachoric_by_generation.png`)

Grid: rows = traits ($\times 2$), columns = generations. Size $5N \times 10$ in.

- **Violins, dots, dashed segments, pair counts**: Same encoding as above (violins = observed tetrachoric correlations, black dashed = true liability correlations, dots = per-replicate estimates), but computed within each generation separately.
- **x-axis labels**: Relationship type names, rotated 30$^\circ$, smaller font.
- **Column titles**: "Gen $g$".
- **Legend** (upper-right of top-right panel): "Liability r" (black dashed).

### Parent-offspring liability regressions (`parent_offspring_liability.png`)

Grid: rows = traits ($\times 2$), columns = last 3 non-founder generations. Size $5N \times 8$ in.

- **Scatter**: Midparent liability ($x$) vs. offspring liability ($y$). Blue points ($\alpha = 0.15$, size 3, rasterised).
- **Orange regression line** (`C3`): Least-squares fit through the scatter, linewidth 2.
- **Text box** (upper-left, white background): "r = X.XXX" (Pearson correlation, averaged across replicates) and "n = XXXXX" (mean pair count).
- **Column titles**: "Gen $g$".
- **Row labels**: "Trait $k$ / Offspring Liability" ($y$-axis), "Midparent Liability" ($x$-axis, bottom row only).

### Narrow-sense heritability by generation (`heritability.by_generation.png`)

$1 \times 2$ figure (10 $\times$ 5 in), one panel per trait.

- **Blue dots**: Per-replicate $h^2 = \text{Var}(A) / (\text{Var}(A) + \text{Var}(C) + \text{Var}(E))$ for each generation, computed from per-generation variance components in `validation.yaml`.
- **Orange dashed line**: Configured heritability ($A_k$ parameter), the expected $h^2$.
- **$y$-axis**: $[0, 1]$, labelled $h^2 = \text{Var}(A) / \text{Var}(L)$.
- **$x$-axis**: Generation number.
- **Interpretation**: Stable $h^2$ across generations confirms that the ACE variance decomposition is maintained through the simulation. Founders (generation 1) have variance components set exactly; subsequent generations should converge to equivalent values under random mating.

Source: [`simace.plotting.plot_correlations`](../api/plotting.md#plot_correlations).
Data from `validation.yaml` -> `per_generation`.

### Broad-sense heritability by generation (`broad_heritability.by_generation.png`)

$1 \times 2$ figure (10 $\times$ 5 in), one panel per trait.

- **Blue dots**: Per-replicate $H^2 = (\text{Var}(A) + \text{Var}(C)) / (\text{Var}(A) + \text{Var}(C) + \text{Var}(E))$ for each generation.
- **Orange dashed line**: Parametric value ($A_k + C_k$).
- **$y$-axis**: $[0, 1]$, labelled $H^2 = (\text{Var}(A)+\text{Var}(C)) / \text{Var}(L)$.
- **$x$-axis**: Generation number.
- **Interpretation**: Comparing $H^2$ with the narrow-sense $h^2$ above isolates the contribution of shared environment to familial resemblance.

Source: [`simace.plotting.plot_correlations`](../api/plotting.md#plot_correlations).

## Threshold Output

Every scenario also writes `phenotype.simple_ltm.parquet`, a binary
liability-threshold phenotype generated by `simace.phenotyping.threshold`.
This file is useful as a benchmark or export target when a pure threshold
phenotype is needed. The current simACE atlas is generated from
`phenotype_stats.yaml` and `phenotype_samples.parquet`, so separate Simple LTM
diagnostic plots are not part of the default scenario atlas.
