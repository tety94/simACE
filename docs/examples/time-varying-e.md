# Time-varying E and h² drift

A core assumption of the standard ACE model is that the variance
components are *constants* of the population — fixed numbers attached
to the trait, inherited from generation to generation as if they were
physical constants of the trait itself. They are not. Real environments
shift across cohorts: education, urbanization, diet, screening
practices, public-health interventions, and many other factors alter
the typical magnitude of the non-genetic, non-shared-environment
contribution to a trait. When the unique-environment variance $v_E$
moves across generations, the realized heritability
$h^2 = v_A / (v_A + v_C + v_E)$ moves with it, even when $v_A$ remains
unchanged. This page describes the form of that drift in simACE output,
its signature in within-cohort relative-pair correlations, the
mis-aggregation incurred by a naive heritability estimator pooled
across cohorts, and the role of the `standardize` configuration mode in
determining whether observed-scale prevalence remains stable or drifts
in lockstep.

The [ACE Model](../concepts/ace-model.md) page explains the variance
decomposition. The [AM and Heritability](am-and-heritability.md) page
covers a different way the population can deviate from its inputs (the
mating system); this page treats the temporal axis instead. Both pages
share the same fundamental warning: the input numbers and the realized
numbers can disagree, and naive estimators do not signal which is being
reported.

## Scenarios

All eight scenarios use a liability-threshold (`adult` / `method: ltm`)
phenotype model on trait 1 with `cip_x0=16.3`, `cip_k=0.376`,
`prevalence=0.1`, `beta=1.0`, `beta_sex=0.0`, identical $A_1=0.5$,
$C_1=0.0$, no AM, $N=100{,}000$, $G_{ped}=G_{pheno}=10$, 3 replicates.
**All scenarios start at $E_1 = 0.5$ in generation 0**, so the gen-0
founder state is identical across them.

The four E trajectories differ in how $E_1$ moves across generations 0–9:

| Trajectory       | $E_1$ schedule (linear, gen 0 → gen 9) |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `e_flat`         | 0.5 constant                           |
| `e_rise_mild`    | 0.5 → 0.6 (Δ = +0.1)                   |
| `e_rise_steep`   | 0.5 → 0.7 (Δ = +0.2)                   |
| `e_fall_steep`   | 0.5 → 0.3 (Δ = −0.2)                   |

Each trajectory has a `_std` and `_nostd` variant with **matched
seeds**: the simulated liability columns are byte-identical within a
pair; only the binary affected status (in `phenotype.parquet`) differs.
The `_std` scenarios use the legacy bool form `standardize: true`,
which the config-load shim resolves to `standardize: "global"`; the
`_nostd` scenarios use `standardize: false` (resolved to
`standardize: "none"`). The third available mode, `"per_generation"`,
is discussed in Observation 4 below as the prevalence-flattening
alternative. Observations 1–3 use the four `_std` scenarios because
they concern the liability scale, where the standardize mode is
invisible. Observation 4 contrasts `_std` against `_nostd`, since that
contrast is precisely the observed-scale axis.

Rebuild all four (and the comparison plots on this page) with:

## Observation 1 — Realized $v_E$ tracks the configured trajectory; $h^2$ drifts with it

The simulator reads the per-generation $E_1$ values from the
configuration dictionary, draws independent normal noise of the
corresponding variance for every individual in that generation, and
adds it to the genetic component to form the liability. If the
simulator behaves as specified, the realized $v_E$ recovered from the
per-individual liability columns should track the input schedule
exactly; $v_A$ should remain flat at the input $0.5$ (no AM, no
selection); and $h^2 = v_A / (v_A + v_E)$ should drift inversely to
$v_E$.

`validation.yaml` records the per-generation realized ACE components
for every replicate, allowing this drift to be examined directly:

![Realized vA, vC, vE, h² by generation across E trajectories](../images/examples/increasing_e/realized_components_trajectory.png)

(A note on gen indexing: simACE stores 0-indexed generations in
`pedigree.parquet` (gens 0–9 for `G_pheno=10`) but labels them 1-indexed
in `validation.yaml` (`generation_1` … `generation_10`). The trajectory
plot here reads `validation.yaml` so its x-axis is 1–10, with **gen 1 =
founders**. The cohort plots later on this page (FS correlation,
Falconer, components-by-generation) read `pedigree.parquet`, so their
x-axis is 0–9 with **gen 0 = founders**. In both cases gen "$N$" is the
same physical cohort under a different label; the figures just inherit
the indexing of the file they read.)

The bottom-left ($v_E$) panel: the horizontal grey dashed line at
$0.5$ is the `e_flat` reference schedule, drawn for visual calibration.
Each solid trace tracks the scenario's *configured* schedule
essentially exactly, with sampling noise smaller than the line
thickness at $N = 100{,}000$ per generation: `e_flat` is flat at $0.5$,
the rising scenarios climb in straight lines toward $0.6$ / $0.7$, and
`e_fall_steep` declines symmetrically toward $0.3$.

The top-left ($v_A$) panel is flat at $0.5$ across *every* scenario,
by construction: $A$ is constant in the configuration and no AM or
selection redistributes it. The top-right ($v_C$) panel is flat at
zero, also by construction. Both confirm that the trajectory of $v_E$
is the *only* component moving across generations.

The bottom-right ($h^2$) panel is the consequence: with $v_A$ fixed and
$v_C = 0$, $h^2 = 0.5 / (0.5 + v_E)$. Substituting the per-generation
$v_E$ values, the $h^2$ trajectories form mirror images of the $v_E$
panel. At the final generation:

- `e_flat` ≈ 0.500 (input, unchanged)
- `e_rise_mild` ≈ 0.455 ($h^2$ fell by ~0.045)
- `e_rise_steep` ≈ 0.417 ($h^2$ fell by ~0.083)
- `e_fall_steep` ≈ 0.625 ($h^2$ *rose* by ~0.125)

The same input ACE parameters can therefore produce materially
different "true" heritabilities across generations of a single
population. This is purely a temporal/cohort effect, with no AM-like
mechanism, no selection, and no environmental cross-transmission.

The trajectory plot displays the variance components as time-series
*numbers*. The same effect is visible as a change in the per-individual
distributions across generations. Sampling three representative cohorts
(gen 1, gen 5, gen 9) and overlaying their distributions of $A_1$ (top)
and total liability $A_1 + E_1$ (bottom):

![Per-individual A and total liability by generation across E trajectories](../images/examples/increasing_e/components_by_gen.png)

Top row (A) is the calibration check: $A_1$ is constant by config, so
all three generations should have indistinguishable distributions in
*every* scenario. They do — SDs sit between 0.705 and 0.708 across all
12 (scenario × generation) cells in the top row, well within sampling
noise.

Bottom row (total liability) is where the story is:

- **`e_flat`**: all three gen curves overlap at SD ≈ 1.00. No drift.
- **`e_rise_mild`**: gen 1 SD ≈ 1.005, gen 5 ≈ 1.027, gen 9 ≈ 1.047.
  Visible widening as later cohorts pick up more E variance.
- **`e_rise_steep`**: gen 1 ≈ 1.009 → gen 9 ≈ 1.094. Wider swing; the
  gen 9 curve is visibly flatter at the peak and fatter in the tails.
- **`e_fall_steep`**: gen 1 ≈ 0.988 → gen 9 ≈ 0.895. Reverse direction —
  the gen 9 curve is *taller and narrower*, because $v_E$ has shrunk.

The widening (or narrowing) of the bottom-row distributions is the
same phenomenon as the bottom-left $v_E$ trace and the bottom-right
$h^2$ trace in the trajectory plot, expressed as a shape change in
per-individual values rather than as a numerical trajectory.

## Observation 2 — Within-cohort FS correlation depends on the generation of the pair

Observation 1 showed how the population's per-generation variance
components shift. Observation 2 is the direct consequence at the
relative-pair level: the expected correlation between full sibs born
into a high-$v_E$ cohort is *lower* than between full sibs born into a
low-$v_E$ cohort, because the non-shared-environment slice of the
liability is independent within the sibling pair. The classical
random-mating expectation $r_{FS} = 0.5 \cdot v_A + v_C$ holds only
when the population has a stable variance structure; with
non-stationary $v_E$, the FS correlation varies cohort by cohort.

The correlation on `liability1` is computed between full-sib pairs in
which *both* members reside in the same generation $g$. Founders are
excluded (they have no parents, hence no FS pairs); MZ twins are
excluded by construction (`simace/core/pedigree_graph.py:_sibling_pairs`
filters on `twin == -1`). The per-replicate $r_{FS}(g)$ is averaged
across the three replicates, with min/max shaded as the envelope.

![Per-cohort FS liability correlation across E trajectories](../images/examples/increasing_e/fs_corr_by_gen.png)

The grey dashed line at $0.250$ is the random-mating expectation
$0.5 \cdot A_1 + C_1 = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 + 0 = 0.25$, matching the value
used in the AM page. Reading each line:

- **`e_flat`** is flat at $\approx 0.250$ across all generations 1–9.
  This is the calibration: when $v_E$ does not move, neither does the
  FS correlation, exactly as the standard model predicts.
- **`e_rise_mild`** starts near $0.249$ in gen 1 and declines
  monotonically to $\approx 0.228$ by gen 9. The slope is shallow
  because the $v_E$ swing is shallow ($\Delta = +0.1$).
- **`e_rise_steep`** declines from $\approx 0.246$ to $\approx 0.210$
  by gen 9; the drop is roughly twice the magnitude of `e_rise_mild`,
  mirroring the doubled $v_E$ swing ($\Delta = +0.2$).
- **`e_fall_steep`** moves in the opposite direction, climbing from
  $\approx 0.262$ at gen 1 to $\approx 0.316$ by gen 9.

The endpoint values match the analytic prediction
$r_{FS} = 0.5 \cdot v_A / (v_A + v_E)$ to within sampling noise: at
$v_A = 0.5$, $v_E = 0.7 \Rightarrow r_{FS} = 0.208$ (steep rise); at
$v_E = 0.3 \Rightarrow r_{FS} = 0.313$ (steep fall).

This is the statistical signature of cohort effects on heritability. A
pedigree-correlation analysis that pools full sibs across generations
and reports a single $r_{FS}$ averages over these moving cohorts; the
returned value is a population-weighted average of cohort-specific
truths, not the truth of any single cohort.

## Observation 3 — Pooled-across-generations naive Falconer matches no generation's truth

Observation 2 established the within-cohort signal; Observation 3
concerns the consequence when the cohort axis is ignored and the
*pooled* relative-pair correlations are inserted into the standard
Falconer formula $h^2 = 2 \cdot (r_{MZ} - r_{FS})$. Within each
cohort, Falconer is well-calibrated: $r_{MZ}$ within gen $g$ is
approximately $v_A / (v_A + v_E^{(g)})$, equal to the realized
$h^2(g)$; $r_{FS}$ within gen $g$ is approximately
$0.5 \cdot v_A / (v_A + v_E^{(g)})$; and their difference scales
correctly. Pooling MZ and FS pairs across all generations smears the
moving truth into a single number that depends on generation-population
weights but matches no individual generation's $h^2$.

The pooled-across-generation Falconer estimate is computed on the full
pedigree (every individual, every generation) for each replicate, and
compared to the per-cohort Falconer estimates and the per-cohort
realized $h^2$:

![Per-cohort vs pooled-across-gens Falconer across E trajectories](../images/examples/increasing_e/cohort_falconer.png)

Each panel corresponds to one trajectory. The blue line is the
per-cohort realized $h^2$ from Observation 1 (the truth). The
rose-coloured line is the per-cohort Falconer estimate (computed
within the cohort using $r_{MZ}$ and $r_{FS}$ on individuals in that
generation). The dark dashed horizontal line is the
pooled-across-generation Falconer estimate.

Reading each panel:

- **`e_flat`**: per-cohort Falconer tracks per-cohort realized $h^2$
  at $\approx 0.50$, and the pooled Falconer dashed line coincides
  with both. No cohort drift, no pooling artefact: the standard model
  recovers the truth.
- **`e_rise_mild`** and **`e_rise_steep`**: the per-cohort lines
  decline in lockstep across generations; the pooled Falconer dashed
  line falls in the middle of the per-cohort range, matching no
  individual generation's truth. For `e_rise_steep` the pooled
  estimate lands at $\approx 0.469$, between gen-1's truth
  ($\approx 0.49$) and gen-9's truth ($\approx 0.42$); for
  `e_rise_mild` the pooled estimate is $\approx 0.477$, between
  truths of $\approx 0.50$ and $\approx 0.45$.
- **`e_fall_steep`**: per-cohort lines climb across generations; the
  pooled Falconer estimate ($\approx 0.537$) sits between gen-1's
  truth ($\approx 0.51$) and gen-9's truth ($\approx 0.625$),
  confirming direction symmetry.

The per-cohort Falconer line is visibly noisier than the
realized-$h^2$ line because per-cohort $r_{MZ}$ rests on only
$\approx 600$ MZ pairs at $N = 100{,}000$ (twin rate $\approx 0.012$);
the standard error on $r_{MZ}$ is therefore meaningful at the
per-generation scale even though it is negligible when pooled.

The diagnostic signal of cohort drift is the *disagreement* between
per-cohort Falconer estimates across generations. When Falconer is
estimated separately by birth-cohort decade and visibly different
numbers result, the population is signalling that the
random-stationarity assumption underlying a single pooled $h^2$ is
wrong for that population.

## Observation 4 — `standardize="global"` offsets but does not flatten prevalence drift under the adult/LTM model

Observations 1–3 concern the liability scale, where the `standardize`
mode is invisible (it affects only the mapping from liability to binary
affected status). Observation 4 examines that mode explicitly. Under
the `adult` / `method: ltm` phenotype model, the threshold is set as
$T = \Phi^{-1}(1 - K)$ where $K$ is the configured prevalence. With
`standardize="global"` (the default; equivalent to the legacy
`standardize: true`), `AdultModel._simulate_ltm` standardizes liability
to mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$ across *the entire pedigree* —
not per-generation — before comparing to $T$. With
`standardize="none"` (legacy `standardize: false`), raw liability is
compared to $T$ directly. A third mode, `standardize="per_generation"`,
flattens the per-cohort drift entirely; see the subsection below.

The matched-seed pairs (`e_*_std` vs `e_*_nostd`) make the
`global`-vs-`none` contrast exact: the pedigree and liability columns
are identical within a pair, so any per-generation prevalence
difference is *purely* due to the standardize choice.

![Per-gen observed prevalence: standardize=global vs none vs per_generation](../images/examples/increasing_e/prevalence_drift.png)

Each panel is one trajectory. Three lines per panel: `standardize="global"`
(legacy `true`), `standardize="none"` (legacy `false`), and
`standardize="per_generation"`. The grey dashed line is the input
$K = 0.10$. The matched-seed `e_*_std` and `e_*_nostd` scenarios feed
the first two lines; the new `e_*_pergen` scenarios (matched seeds again)
feed the third.

### The age-censoring artefact (gens 0–3)

In every panel both lines sit at exactly $0$ for generations 0–3 and
jump up at gen 4. This is not a bug; it reflects the LTM age-of-onset
model. With `cip_x0 = 16.3` and `cip_k = 0.376`, the cumulative
incidence probability for a case is logistic with midpoint at age
$16.3$, so cases that would eventually onset do not manifest until
approximately age 12 or later. The pipeline assigns each generation an
age of observation that decreases for younger generations (gen 9 is
"now", gen 0 is the oldest ancestor cohort); the youngest individuals
have not aged into onset by their censor window and therefore appear
0%-affected even though their *liabilities* match those of their
ancestors. Generations 4–9 should be read.

### Effect of `global` vs `none` (gens 4–9)

- **`e_flat`**: both lines sit at $\approx 0.100$ across gens 4–9. This
  is the calibration baseline; it matches the configured $K = 0.10$
  within sampling noise.
- **`e_rise_mild`**: `standardize="global"` rises $0.099 \to 0.105$
  ($\Delta = +0.006$); `standardize="none"` rises $0.104 \to 0.111$
  ($\Delta = +0.007$). The two slopes are nearly identical;
  `"global"` shifts the absolute level by $\approx 0.005$–$0.006$ but
  does not reduce the per-generation drift.
- **`e_rise_steep`**: `"global"` $0.098 \to 0.109$ ($\Delta = +0.011$);
  `"none"` $0.109 \to 0.120$ ($\Delta = +0.011$). The same pattern
  obtains; the swing is larger than for `e_rise_mild` because $v_E$
  swings more.
- **`e_fall_steep`**: `"global"` $0.101 \to 0.086$ ($\Delta = -0.015$);
  `"none"` $0.090 \to 0.075$ ($\Delta = -0.014$). Direction symmetric;
  slopes again match but the offsets differ.

The key fact is that the slopes are essentially identical between
`_std` and `_nostd`. The `"global"` mode adjusts the *level* of the
per-generation prevalence — rising-$E$ scenarios have lower prevalence
under `"global"` because the cohort-wide standardization scales
liability by $\sqrt{\text{global } v_L}$, which exceeds $1$ when
late-generation $v_E$ is high, and falling-$E$ exhibits the opposite
shift — but it does not undo the per-cohort drift caused by
per-generation $v_E$ differences.

### Why `standardize="global"` does not flatten here

`AdultModel._simulate_ltm` (`simace/phenotyping/models/adult.py`) under
`standardize="global"` computes `L = (L - L.mean()) / L.std()` across
*the entire pedigree*. This collapses the population mean and standard
deviation to $(0, 1)$ but leaves the *between-generation* variance
ratios intact. A generation with above-average $v_E$ retains
above-average post-standardization variance and therefore retains more
upper-tail mass beyond the fixed threshold.

### How `standardize="per_generation"` flattens it

The third mode, `standardize="per_generation"`, z-scores liability
within each generation independently before comparing to $T$. Under
this mode every generation hits its target $K$ exactly, regardless of
how $v_E$ drifts across cohorts — visible directly in the green line
in each panel above, which sits flat at $K = 0.10$ for all four E
trajectories. The same thing happens automatically in the
`phenotype.simple_ltm.parquet` benchmark output that every scenario
produces alongside its main phenotype: that benchmark calls
`apply_threshold` from `simace/phenotyping/threshold.py`, which honors
the same global `standardize` flag. So setting
`standardize: per_generation` in the scenario YAML simultaneously
flattens the `adult` / `method: ltm` prevalence drift *and* the
simple-LTM benchmark drift.

The trade-off is the same as before: per-generation standardization
erases any real population-level signal that happens to map onto the
variance-by-generation axis. Choose the mode that matches the question
being asked.

### Implications

The choice of phenotype model, and within it which `standardize` mode
is selected, silently determines whether registry-style prevalence will
drift across cohorts under non-stationary $E$. `standardize="global"`
preserves prevalence cohort-wide but lets it drift per generation;
`standardize="per_generation"` preserves prevalence per generation but
absorbs the per-cohort variance signal; `standardize="none"` reports
the raw drift directly. All three are legitimate, but they answer
different questions. The pitfall is to treat any of them as
"calibrated to $K$" without checking what its standardize step
actually performs.
